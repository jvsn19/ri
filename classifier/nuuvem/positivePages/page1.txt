Order key  About the game We Happy Few is the tale of a plucky bunch of moderately terrible people trying to escape from a lifetime of cheerful denial in the city of Wellington Wells  In this alternative  s England  conformity is key  You’ll have to fight or blend in with the drug addled inhabitants  most of whom don’t take kindly to people who won’t abide by their not so normal rules  Discover the retrofuturistic city’s dark history as you play through the intertwined narratives of three quietly rebellious citizens of Wellington Wells  each with their own strengths and weaknesses  as they face their pasts  prepare for the future  and engage in activities that aren’t exactly status quo in the artificially enthused society  Highlights Retrofuturistic  s England  Set in retrofuturistic  s England  you will find a city ravaged by war and rebuilt by delusionally happy people  Everything appears joyful in Wellington Wells  including its roads  its people  and its omnipresent television personality  Uncle Jack  But  it’s actually a world on the brink of collapse  Come unveil its dark history  and discover how and why its residents came to be so beguilingly happy  Three Interwoven Narratives  Play as three flawed characters who explore their own connections to the events surrounding the rebuilding of Wellington Wells  They each have a unique storyline in which they interpret and react to the events around them in different ways  As you hide  conform  or fight back as each of them  you will encounter dark humour  a spot of hope  and even some redemption along the way   A Dystopia of Your Very Own  In We Happy Few  no two playthroughs are alike  While the citizens of Wellington Wells will always want to ensure that you’ve taken your Joy  the procedurally generated world will ensure that your experience with We Happy Few is different and unique  Wellington Wells is never quite like you remember it  Take Your Joy…or Don’t  The Choice is Yours Customize your We Happy Few experience  Choose from a range of difficulties for new and experienced players alike Play through the story  or make your own story by customizing the sandbox   Masochistic  Try permadeath  Collect recipes  scavenge items  and craft dozens of weapons  tools  and devices   Creep  crush  or conform your way through puzzles and encounters  and Fight with the crazy weapons you can craft  or fight with your bare hands and don’t kill anyone  System Requirements  Windows Minimum OS  Windows     bit  Storage    GB Processor  Triple core Intel   AMD    GHz
