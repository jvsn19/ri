this review helpful to you  D Farmville with pixelated graphics russel_vjd  Staxel is fun especially for younger kids who wants to experience some farming life manage resources make friends and build your farm as you like when you start the game the first thing comes to mind is the undeniable resemblance to Minecraft series especially from characters and environmental designs But its not a simple copycat it has its unique features to make your experience fun and adorable the economy system it uses is simple you grow stuff in your farm sell them and buy upgrades to build and expand your farm and create a tiny empire of your own Staxel is on early access and I think it has the potential to improve in lots of aspects it uses your imagination to give you the power of creating great stuff of your own and I really think its a great thing for this game and if you like to challenge yourself Staxel could be a great choice for you   Load More Load More User rating totalScore  toScore
