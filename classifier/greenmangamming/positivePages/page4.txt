of older titles that fans of the genre should remember lconanl  I did not play Final Fantasy Tactics so there are no comparisons with it in the review Children of Zodiarcs is a very good game with interesting mechanics turnbased JRPG and card game blended in one neat package The game takes place in an original fantasy world with elements of steampunk The main characters are a group of children from a gang of poor thieves who are trying to survive and at the same time rise up in status by stealing relics from the rich The visual style of the game is pleasant but unfortunately that has less impact than it should have because of certain design choices The whole game takes place on the world map screen on the small but detailed maps of the battles dialogues emerge neatly not obstructing the background And now for the minuses The game has several and while they did not represent significant inconveniences for me they can seriously spoil the game for others Firstly theres the slowness of the animation of the enemies You have to wait for the enemy to reach its targetted place at a leisurely pace choose the ability throw the dice they roll you will be shown the effect of the numbers on the dice and only then the enemy will apply the ability All this is to be repeated numerous times depending on the number of enemies Second is also about the enemies They are stupid AI can stand still until the character reaches its field of vision or other times run to the character across the entire map or can attack headon or even counterattack immediatly even when you strike from behind Such shortcomings in a tactical game are at least deterring from the experience Thirdlly its the obtuse level design and camera When you hit the battle card for the first time you are advised to twist the camera to your leisure to make the unwanted details transparent And the levels as I said are quite detailed and far from flat its just not always possible to find a convenient position between this box that balcony and that wall to see both the character and the enemy And finally the fourth Autoleveling of enemies If you have a hero in your party for example level  and the remaining two are level  then the enemies will adjust to the strongest character   or  levels So if you decided to pump out characters on side battles and then took in the party a new underleveled character then all you can do is pray youre still alive after a few battles pass But in general the game captivates with its original gameplay and colorful world especially if you like tactical RPG In addition we must not forget that the game came out a couple of days ago and is just in need of patches While I did not reach the final level yet I can not evaluate the whole plot and sidemissions the game has to offer but the many hours I put into it already left a positive impression on me despite all its shortcomings Warmly if cautiously recommended  Interesting but too much based on luck gmgtochuje  Children of Zodiarcs is an interesting mix of a tactical game with card game blend together with a dice Interesting concept but there is a problem here as this leaves some the player depending a little too much on his own luck because all the skills may not be worth a single dime if you just get a low number on the dice But nevertheless I found this game very interesting and for the price its worth checking
