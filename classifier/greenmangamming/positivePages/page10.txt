helpful to you  They did it again Scarwiz  Rise of the Tomb Raider has got to be the most beautiful game Ive played to date Starting strong with a jaw dropping snowy mountain sequence the game gives you a quick taste of whats to come While the scenery is by and large very similar to the previous iteration the updated graphics really make the world pop Gameplaywise Rise of the Tomb Raider takes a very similar approach as the  reboot Most encounters can be tackled head on or through stealth and using your environment to fight enemies is encouraged The biggest difference would be in world design While the previous game was separated in areas you had little reason to go back to apart from collecting trinkets this game opens up the world and introduces side quests and some of the usual open world tropes The side quests are nothing to write home about bordering on fetch quests and challenges The main story is as engaging as the first one though Involving the Croft family to a deeper effect it really digs into Laras character and set her up as the heroine shes bound to become At the cutting edge of video game technology Rise of the Tomb Raider is a must play for anyone in search of spectacle  Visually jawdropping but a step back storywise RF_  Rise of the Tomb Raider keeps the core gameplay of its predecessor while expanding on several aspects There is a new crafting system a larger variety of skills to master new weapons and attachments to collect as well as various new ways to interact with the environment Some classic Tomb Raider elements are back in RoTR most notably Lara gets to swim now even if vertical movement is very limited and there are plenty of traps reminiscent of the first games in the franchise Visually this is one of the most gorgeous games I have ever played The soundtrack and sound effects also deliver in setting the tone Unfortunately I felt the game was ultimately held back by its story and characters neither as compelling as in the  instalment This is no longer a survival story but a more generic exploration one allies even commenting on how Lara can leave whenever she wants as that is not her fight Wild life provides more of a challenge this time around but the main enemies just dont feel like an overpowering force as the Solari did back in the reboot Laras allies also fail to engage the player in any meaningful way Noteworthy is the option to replay previously completed chapters which can also be changed in a number of ways Blood Ties mode provides a very entertaining combatfree exploration of the iconic Croft Manor I did not care for Laras nightmare or Cold Darkness Awakened I just felt they had nothing to do with the franchise A final note on one of the nicest additions to the game Endurance a survival mode which can be played solo or with a partner Besides having to survive the same animal human and undefined enemies present in the main campaign one must also watch out for traps and keep Lara and partner warm and fed at all times Despite its rather generic story opponent and allies Rise of the Tomb Raider keeps Lara Crofts adventures on course  This is a must have for whom like the series Rippzr  Ive always liked the series loved the previous game and this one takes another step forward best game of the series ever done if you like Tomb Raider games you will love this one played whole game except DLCs and even have it on youtube compelling story and brutal gfx Gets a  from me  A definitely must have for fans of the series russel_vjd  Rise of the Tomb Raider is exactly what its expected to be an attractive delicious and beautiful game worthy of the name of Lara Croft and a Tomb Raider game A real and charismatic character fascinating environments great temples and a fictional adventure game which all made it one of the most memorable games of  especially on PC also gameplay of Rise of the Tomb Raider is still fascinating you have two ways to destroy your enemies stealth or facetoface combat Crystal Dynamics has been able to blend these two styles perfectly so you are totally free to choose between stealth and fighting face to face and considering the excellent design of the game choosing how it ends is a tough battle so If youre looking for an adventure do not miss the Rise of the Tomb Raider  Environmental design and elements are better than before JacKi_Hound  The title Rise of the Tomb Raider can be described as the evolved version of the Tomb Raider  a work that perfectly addresses the weaknesses of the previous version and even made them part of their successful experience The Rise of the Tomb Raider is a game which made the graphic and visual elements in serve of gameplay and stories and does not exaggerate the cinematic experience for the player and this has given a pleasurable rhythm to gameplay The Rise of The Tomb Raider can be described as the best Xbox One title in terms of visual and special design environments and one of the bests in eighthgeneration Load More Load More User rating totalScore  toScore totalScoreText Rate  Review Simply rate this game out of  stars and submit reviewScoreText Submit Want to
