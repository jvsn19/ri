person   people  found this helpful  Was this review helpful to you    A good Far Cry game coldrefreader   Usually when I think of Far Cry  I don t imagine outstanding story and characters  but the fact of how dumb and fun the franchise can be  Far Cry   isn t really an exception   it is a lot of fun  in a dumb way  you can hold up to   shovels and throw them like a weapon  Another amazing thing is how polished and how well it runs   playing on ultra doesn t melt your PC and it is incredibly smooth  The story is about saving the US from some odd cult and that s about it  It does lack some lovely Far Cry features  like the lack of knife takedowns  Also  the multiplayer is in an odd position   you can play co op with your friends  but if you want to host or join a lobby  you must have at least   players there  It also appears to be timed  But this is all about Far Cry   on release  expect it to become a much better game as time goes on  Load More Load More User rating  totalScore
