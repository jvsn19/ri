rPositiveVotesCount      person  people found this helpful Was this review helpful to you  Most enjoyable final fantasy game ive played roxaslenobody  Played this back when it was on PS got pretty far and really enjoyed playing it after selling it and only getting a few dollars thanks gs i really wanted to play it again but I waited knowing that Im sure one day they would remaster it like how many games have been ported for mobile phones in the final fantasy games PS got a release and I had a feeling PC would get one as well just like how FFXX did when it was first rereleased after buying it with the  discount and then another discount on top of that i got it for roughly  which is an amazing price for it just getting out and all playing it all over again but with the new job system and such that was never before seen for US its an enjoyable game and the fact that they let you use subtitles and Japanese audio and then you can even pick if you want original OST or the reorchestrated versions for music is a really nice addition to the game  can see myself playing this game several times  Rare gem among FF Roo  FF  is a rare gem among the series Its totally diffrent to other FF in the series The combat is different to the regular turned based style as before If youre new to ff or never played  if there is a demo try it or watch video cause this lovely game either you love it or hate it for the combat changes In this version job system have been revamped a bit orchestra of songs remade for the better and so on You get the classic jobs as white mage black mage knight and so on You play in the world of Ivalice where the empire wages war across Ivalice and youre this tiny bit of country called Dalmasca Dalmasca gets invaded and captured by the empire and so the story begins that you build up a resistance against the empire and so on to try to retake it back and free the Dalmascan people of empires control  Yet another Final fantasy game coldrefreader  Final fantasy has always been about an RPG full of exploration and hunting FF zodiac is a remaster of the game from PS Although the story voice acting and dialogue are pretty lackluster the rpg character element and combat make up for it Unfortunately it feels like a cakewalk with most bosses and mobs who cant really pose any challenge It is also a bit expensive for what it is a remaster and not a very good one
