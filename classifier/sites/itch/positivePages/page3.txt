Dobry_GamePlay  hours agoÐÐ¾Ð´Ð½Ð¾   Reply Silentduck  day agoA very cool fnaf style game it was actually quite challenging but the mechanics made the game very fun and interesting good luck on the future of this Reply JayPlaysOfficial  day agoMONSTERS ARE REAL    Darkness Dwells This was such a freaky game  too bad i couldnt complete the level or night   other than that i thought this game was awesome   DReply StepVibes  day agoGave it a go Reply JayskiBean  day agoThis game was pretty good  I kinda felt like there were a few bugs  so let s talk about those first before the praise  Every time I failed or died  the mouse would stop working for some reason and I d have to minimize maximize the game to make it work again  running in fullscreen  At one point  the LMB was not grabbing the blankets and pulling them up  ultimately leading to death  Aaaaand the rocking horse monster seemed to pop in multiple instances quite often  Spamming the flashlight fixes that  but I m not entirely sure if it is inentional  Err  I see you re working on the horse  Awesome  Now for praise  This game s atmosphere and voice acting was actually well done  In my video  the audio for the voices was pretty choppy  I have NO idea why  Every time I restarted the night  they d sound fine  It was just choppy the first time  The thunder scared me almost EVERY time it hit  The  monster  designs and models were awesome  I especially loved  The Babadook  jumpscare  the closet monster  The mechanics were simple  but still difficult  I love having to deal with uniformity and prioritizing things  I know a lot of people are saying  ITS LIKE FNAF    but you do you  It s hard to not do something that FNAF has already done anymore  Thanks for making this  Reply cabbagewarrior  days agoI just got done playing for a bit  I didn t get too far  but I did have fun with it  The environment is great and the models are spooky  The little rocking horse guy got me too much  but it s all good  He ll probably lure me into a false sense of security and something else will get me later  We ll see  I ll definitely be playing this again  I did find a way to cheese the blanket by simply holding LMB the whole time and only letting off to flash what I needed to flash  Not sure if that s intended or not Reply NathanBlakeGames  days ago so I played your game and had a lot of fun   I m not sure if I was running into a bug or not   but at any rate  hope you enjoy  Reply DarknessDwells  days ago Hey  Nathan Blake  Yeah there are still a few issues and thanks for the suggestion about mentioning the bug in the description  We are absolutely still adding to this and trying to make it as good as it deserves but time was against us  There will be an update as soon as we can manage it along with a teaser of what may come later  We re really glad you liked it all the same Reply NathanBlakeGames  days agoThanks a lot  I really did have fun  I just also like to be as helpful and as honest as possible too   Reply Neco The Sergal  days ago Welp   I triedReply DarknessDwells  days ago Hey  Neco  Yes you absolutely tried and we appreciate that  thanks for playing and showing off our work  You re right  some things aren t meant to do that  we are working on it but are short on time currently  An update will be coming shortly that should have most of this ironed out  Thanks for giving it a shot though  Reply DatMasterHunts  days ago It is a good concept  and it really reminds me of the first level of Joy of Creation  It definitely requires polish however  but I already seen that you are going to make adjustments  I was also not expecting voice acting as well  Which was a plus on my books  It s going along great over there Reply DarknessDwells  days ago  Edited   time  Hey DatMasterHunts  There are some obvious issues at present but release was required  Fix one thing  break a bunch of others  you know how development is  Thanks for playing and we re really happy you like even where it s up to  We ll let you know when it s been updated  We WILL have a good time  Reply CoalFire  days ago I have to admit I was a bit disappointed to see this was a fnaf style horror game  but you ve absolutely nailed the atmosphere  Not entirely sure if I didn t understand the mechanics fully  but it did seem a little buggy as well  Reply DarknessDwells  days ago Hey CoalFire  thanks for playing  Yeah  it seems like there were some issues going on that we didn t come up against in development  so they will be looked into soon as the game is still being developed  Updates are coming but we re happy you gave it a shot Reply Fellowplayer  days ago I was able to complete the game I figured out how to deal with him  a good level of difficulty and scares thrown in   It will be a great addition to the collection    YouTuber   FellowplayerReply VcPenguin  days agoThanks for playing  we re all super happy you liked it  Keep an eye out for updates in the future that might make your experience
