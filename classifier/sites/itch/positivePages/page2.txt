I first downloaded it but Holy Hell am I glad I did You Left Me is just Fu king beautiful  the sound track alone is reason enough to play Reply Neco The Sergal  hours agoHad to go with the Live ending Reply bl nk  hours ago This game is absolutely an amazing experience  Great job Reply Famed Killjoy  hours ago Beautiful  Absolutely beautiful  If I were to describe the game with one word  that would be it  The sense of style when it comes to the art is on a whole other level here  just like with your other works  the art you present is phenomenal and deserves a high amount of praise  It helps to create this surreal atmosphere shrouded in mystery that is perfect given the underlying themes  The music used throughout the game also adds to this sense of surrealism  and I loved it  The story is of course quite dark and grim  as with any story involving loss of any kind  It s never easy to just "move on" and look past things  people can try to understand what it is you re feeling but they re on the outside looking in  only you can truly understand your thoughts and feelings  What happens then when even you can t understand your own thoughts and feelings  You might feel confused  angry  or depressed  This is when you re the most vulnerable  and also when you re the most alone  Some of those people on the outside looking in might take this as an opportunity to push themselves onto you  such as in a work setting  Others might see you simply as a thing to "cure"  In the end though it s up to you to try and sort through it all  and that s what I ve taken away from the story of this game  No one can force you to "give in" or "survive" it s up to you to look within yourself to find that strength that will hopefully lead you to the right answer  I m sorry if I got a bit rambly there  the game certainly got me thinking a lot  Not just about what was happening during the game  but in my own life  and that s how you know that you ve created something truly special   In closing  this isn t just a game  but an experience  You ve created something magnificent here that I have no doubt will speak to countless other people  I m glad I got the chance to play it  I hope you don t mind but I made a let s play of the game for my channel  where I believe I got every ending though I m unsure   Cheers and best wishes to you  KilljoyReply shrekster  hours agoThank you for this game  and seriously keep making these type of games to raise awareness  I love this game  though short I cried after the recording  I related so much  and really patched up some negative thoughts I have been having recently  Much Love Shrekster  Reply Draknus  day agoThis game is wonderful  Thank you  Reply vampcute  day agoThe game is very very deep and send a very good messege of suicide  loneliness  and depression  I really am loving the art style because it really suits the atmosphere of the game and I also want to know the music name  It really hits people that has suicidal thought  been suicidal  feeling depressed  and loneliness har because I always feel lonely at home and get really depress when get scold at for whatever reason that would be  I am the only child and has been living with my parents but when I m in my room all alone and I feel lonely from time to time even though I am living with my parents  I have to have someone I could text  talk  call  and hangout not all the time unless in the mood  ALL THE TIME  This game really hits me hard and  I am happy that I play this wonderful game  â¥Reply Majoma  day agoYou can find the three songs of the game in the "About" section Reply vampcute  hours agoThank you my dude  Reply Sora Album  day agoThe subtle movement of the interface and the depiction of the main character s environment strengthen her post trauma view and experience  also written with such effective hints through the full scenario of her circumstance  " Many thumbs up for your great work ^^Reply Maineiacs  days agoThis is a very good yet depressing game  The art style is unique and well done  the audio works well for the environment  and the writing is well done  When I first looked at this game I didn t know what to expect  The art style is crazy looking but after playing it  works so well for the environment of the world  For those wondering what this game is about  it may put some people off  The game puts you in the shoes of someone who has lost a loved one to suicide  But rather than you controlling the lost loved one  You play through the eyes of the other victim in this scenario  It s hard to think about who else may have been hurt in the event of something like this happening  But this type of scenario doesn t just effect the victim  but everyone around them as well  I enjoy playing these types of games in that the developer is passionate enough about this to the point that they create a unique and intense game to show their perspective  All in all a very intense and to the point story that gives you an alternate perspective in this particular tragedy  I did a video on my experience with the game if anyone is interested in seeing what this game has to offer Reply Angela He  day agoGreat comment  I like to think it s about losing someone in general  not just through suicide Reply MADGaming  days agoSuch a strange game  Enjoyed it apart from the music blasting my ear drums into next month Reply Majoma  days ago  Edited   time  I got the two good endings I don t know if there are others  I will eventually go for them another time  at the first try  And I m not saying it because I feel awesome or something  but because I went trough the same struggle  You have to keep trying  to remember the good things  especially if your pain is strongly related to the loss of somebody you cared about or loved  I don t agree with some people saying stuff like "you have to teach people meds are good and blablabla"  that s not the point of the game  for me  The point is showing how someone feels when pain is too much  to show how this pain sometimes can even put you in confusion  struggling to stay put in reality and not in the awful living nightmare your mind is putting you in  So  this is from a victim point  Where nothing matters  and nobody can help you  in this nightmare  But if you continue to try  there s always a way  and you can be able to finally see it  And I m really happy on how you can get the good ending  because those choices were absolutely realistic  and that s why I was able to finish it with no struggle at all since I ve been living those feelings  too  I knew what to do to help her  Thank you for your beautiful work  and for dedicating this to people like us  Reply Frosted Fricks  days agoThank you again for making such an awesome in depth game  I really love the artwork that you do and I feel the game sends a really good message Reply GirlGamerGaB  days agoThanks for the beautiful game Reply Silentduck  days agoExcellent visual novel very cool style and i felt it was very tasteful evan with a serious topic I look forward to more thanks Reply DonateToMyPaypal  days agoThis game truly touched me  And the fact that it was made in only   hours is amazing  The art is beautiful  as well as the music  Thank you so much for making this game Reply facy  days agoany chance to upload the whole project please i really like your work and love to learn from youReply RETROGAMEMAGE  days agoPlayed through the game   times  This game really is a beautiful piece of art in bits and as a whole  Just truly well done all around  I really loved the cat  My Dude  and the shaken world altered reality vibe some go through after experiencing the loss of a loved one is really fleshed out here  Amazing work Reply Skydjinn  days agoYOU LEFT ME is an artistic approach to point n click style adventure games with just enough of a surreal theme to keep things interesting throughout  The ability to pan the camera around the images has a nice feel to it  almost like the player is looking into a diorama of an emotional story unfolding  The music  while not necessarily to my taste  definitely worked well with the dreamworld surrealism going on  Overall  this was quite the experience  and I liked your way of conveying messages  Good job on this  I ve seen your art before  but never knew who it belonged to  You ve a nice style Reply Ridonculousguy  days agoJust like the previous   games that I have played of yours this one was also absolutely fantastic and touched upon even more heavier subject than the previous two Artstyle and game mechanics were undoubtedly beautiful and really really good I loved how things were portrayed in an artistic way to show how things were for the character when she is going through such a sad phase Cat and the moon were good addition as it quite lightened the atmosphere though moon s jokes mostly went over my mind XD I had a great and quite a serious time with this game and I hope to play many more games by you in the future  Reply DDLCIsMYFav  days agoI haven t gotten all the endings yet  which I plant to do  but what I believe to be the true ending was really poignant for me  The art is gorgeous  and you captured exactly how it feels to lose someone who s especially close to you  Sometimes  it can feel like an abyss  but there s always a reason behind everything  I believe  Even the difficult stuff  Good job  developer Reply gabbyfisch  days agothis is such a well done game  especially considering this was done in   hours  thank you for making and sharing this with us  you are such a skilled artist and storyteller Reply FloofzyKitten  days agoI really like the art style but I can t agree with the message the game is trying to portray  The game clearly expresses that talking to those around you is useless  going to a professional clinic will only have you be ridiculed and the GP said they don t know how to help them  at that point they would have given them a referral to a mental health professional  I know because I ve been through this and so have my sisters  If a doctor doesn t know how to deal with a problem they send you to one that does know how to deal with it  so that protrayal of doctors was really inaccurate   The game may have a good ending but it seems most routes end in suicide  which although may be a reality for a lot of people  for many others they end up at the end of the tunnel by talking to professionals and getting support from loved ones   The way the game calls antidepressants "happy pills" is a really negative message considering antidepressants aren t supposed to be "happy pills"  never have and never will be  They re to help people counteract depression and to help people dealing with depression get out of bed in the morning  Overall  the game has a nice art style but the messages it communicates are either inaccurate or outdated  I know a decade or two back  perhaps this would have been the reality for those suffering from depression  but these days  it s really easy to find help since there s so many places you can go  The real problem is taking those steps and that s the message I expected from this game  but  it seems that the journey and the destination are worthless in this game Side Note  I know this game is in the perspective of someone who is depressed  so antidepressents may appear as happy pills to them  but when they went to see a professional that should have helped at least a little  Also  it seems they went to see a GP but a GP isn t authorised to prescribe antidepressants without a note from a mental health professional  They don t just hand out antidepressants to people they think may be depressed  remember  GP s are only very minimally trained in mental health but that s enough for them to know when they should refer someone to a mental health professional Reply Angela He  days agoI think you have a great argument and point to make  But I think you ve interpreted the game as fact  as explicit  when the surreality implies to not take it at face value  I never said the happy pills were antidepressants  either  I just said they re to fight the pain   they could be benzos or opioids  The game s supposed to represent the despair  isolation  and emotions that a person might feel after losing someone  Help  yes  is crucial to healing  But sometimes you can t get help   maybe your parents refuse to believe your pain is real  maybe your friends tell you to get over it  Maybe you have nobody  I ll keep your point about medical professionals in mind   I personally have had terrible experiences with them  but I shouldn t let that blind me  Thanks for sharing your opinion  The fact that my game came across as such was not what I wanted  and I would revise it  however  this game has honestly been too emotionally taxing for me to make  I don t want to touch it again Reply FloofzyKitten  days ago I m sorry you had bad experiences with doctors  Whenever I or my sisters have gone to a GP for a mental health problem  we may not even know it s a mental health problem at first  it can be difficult to distinguish between the two sometimes  they usually give us two referrals  One to a counsellor and one to a doctor qualified to diagnose mental illness  This is of course after testing for deficiencies  but we always get to proper help in the end and we re a lot better because of it You make a strong point about depression skewing reality  which I like but the elements of reality and what s distorted is confusing for those playing  Making the player experience what the protagonist is feeling is important  but when it gets in the way of the core values of the game or miscommunicates something it can leave multiple  possible unwanted interpretations  In my case  I tried to interpret it in three ways One where the game was entirely in someone s imagination  one where everything was reality and one where it was somewhere in between  Your game falls somewhere in between meaning  like I said before  what is real and what is distorted is unclear and since you re the creator it s probably glaringly obvious to you but to those who don t have insight into who the creator is and their motives  such as your bad experiences with doctors   assumptions have to be made in order to reach a conclusion I understand how you can come into a project with so many hopes and aspirations and for the reservoir to be drained by the end  so you don t need to worry about touching the game again  especially since the various interpretations were due to miscommunication and not from morose intentions  As a word of warning  I think if you don t make a statement regarding the multiple interpretations it will continue to be perceived that way Reply TheBetterStory  days agoFrom what I could see while playing  the mental health professionals aren t all that helpful  but going to the clinic will give you the option to go to the grave if you give the right answers  And I found the conversation with the coworker  which for me ended with them offering to visit the grave with me and saying we should talk more  was a good way to show the benefits of reaching out Reply unlimitedjelly  days agoAmazing job as usual c   Gorgeous art  smooth interactions  cute and funny parts mixed in with the heavy topics    The way everything moves with the mouse really adds to the dreaminess   I liked how the happy pills are little smiley faces   My favorite pictures were the boss and the train [Possible bug ]I m not sure if it s part of the game  but  there s a part where I can t move forward anymore   I think it s at  pm  after I ve stayed late at work   There aren t any buttons and time doesn t pass   I can still open the menu so I m wondering if I just haven t found what to click Reply Angela He  day agoThanks unlimitedjelly ^_^  nice name haha  I can t seem to reproduce this  I tried doing some things that could ve fixed it but are really shots in the dark  Lmk if you still get the bug Reply roy_g  days agoThe artwork is stunning  Wrote a review to let our fans know about your work  ] https peachscastle com

Congratulations to everyone involved on this project Thank you very much guys for the experience Reply sirfancylot  days agoALL   ENDINGS EXPLAINED   YOU LEFT ME Full Gameplay WalkthroughReply Servants of the Secret Fire Game Studios  days agoAn excellent selection of music and original graphics that extends into the field of art  like as you were being tickled by Salvador Dali s mustache actually  makes this game incredible attractive and sets the mood for the thematic intended to be discuss  In my opinion  this game did not make it well regarding the theme for this LDJAM   unless of course  life and death were the incompatible things intended in this game to be mixed Reply ravenna  days agoit isnt working on windows for meReply Angela He  days agoWhat isn t working Reply ravenna

a very surreal game  Even though almost everything is alive  it still feels empty  in a good way  sorry i didn t take it as seriously as it was Reply GameGabe  days agoThis game was great  the artstyle was fantastic  I wasn t quite happy with my ending but i m excited to find out other endings  Great job  Reply JayskiBean  days ago This is beautiful  The artwork  The music  The message  It was so incredible of you to create this masterpiece  It has so much potential to help people remember that they are not alone when the world feels like it s crashing down on them  It helps people who haven t suffered a loss of this magnitude to understand what it feels like  or at least have a decent idea  I ve never personally lost a close loved one  and I couldn t imagine what it d feel like  but this really touched me  I m terrible at comforting people or helping people through hard times  but now that I have a bit of a better understanding  I feel like I can help  Before  I felt useless  like nothing I could say or do could comfort someone in need  I know this point of view is probably rare to hear about your game  but it helps everyone  Even those who you wouldn t think  Thanks so much for making this  you re amazing at what you do   Hopefully I didn t ramble on too much  Again  I m bad at this sort of thing  Reply Angela He  days agoHey  thanks for sharing your viewpoint  I enjoyed your rambling  keep at it haha  You sound quite eloquent   open  I m sure you ll do just fine at supporting people < Reply JayskiBean  days agoAw thank you  You re too nice   DReply onion
