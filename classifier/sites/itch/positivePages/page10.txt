would ask you something  I m also interested to make a great conquest game  is it really hard to do it with one person   Because I ve actually only a map generator with random king   emperor name but nothing more  Thx  DReply noblemaster  days agoIt s possible but it takes time  I suggest find a good artist and maybe someone that helps with modding Reply DRitachi  days agonoble aster i love this game i allways play it on my computer but i want to download it on my ipad   but its not compatible can you do anythingReply noblemaster  days agoYou need iOS   and a  bit processor at minimum  I am sorry for that  but anything lower and the game tends to crash on iOS Reply pyhavk  year agoI just installed this in Windows   and get an error "Error opening media file  Please move this file to an ascii only path like c \"  What does it mean and how do I troubleshoot this Reply noblemaster  year agoThat s an odd error message  Did you install it via the itch io app  Can you download the game directly  unzip   run it Reply pyhavk  year agoAh yes it works independently  but fails to start with that strange error from the Itch io app  I guess I ll start it independently for now  but is there a way to fix this  Thanks Reply noblemaster  year agoIt seems the game doesn t like that path  However  generally  you given it s the portable version it should work in any path  Do you have any special characters in the install path of the game  Can you move the path in itch io Reply pyhavk  year agoThere are no special characters in its path  Just to be clear  I installed the game successfully via the Itch io app  but it fails to start from within the Itch io app  However  it works if I manually navigate to where the game is installed by Itch io  and the game starts normally when I double click on the executable  So it sounds like a problem with the Itch io app Reply noblemaster  year agoYes  it might have something to do with the itch io app if you are able to start the game directly  However  I assume you are successfully able to start other games What you could try  not sure if that s the case  to move the itch io app game to a directory with only ASCII characters  E g  from "C \Ãber\ "  > "C\Uber\ "  Not sure if that s where your games reside  If you have only ASCII characters for the game s path  it s odd that that error message would happen however  Maybe try to talk with the itch io team as well ReplyView more in thread NK  year agohow do i play without downloadingReply noblemaster  year agoIt s not a browser based game  You need to download it
