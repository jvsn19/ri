 DThe tasks were simple but yet fun to do Reply gamejamcurator  hours agoThat was a sweet and funny game    I liked the different reactions of the date that show up when I take  too  long with a task  <  Smiling  shocked or even angry   D A pure joy  The three tasks were also managable  but when one isn t too familiar with the control scheme  it takes a while   that s the point of this marvelous game  though  <  Thanks for this Ludum Dare   that I happily recommended in one of our compilation articles about the jam  along with two other great games  also  it s featured in the related video    Thanks again and keep up the good work Best wishes SebastianReply ProofreadFire  day agoNothing more fun then flinging cutlery through your dates chest cavity It was a lot of fun  great job Reply Skydjinn  day agoA short  but fun game  Check  Please  combines all the romance of a dinner date with the joy of using simulated hands  Graphically  it has a simple  yet well crafted design  with all the models have  some level of detail  but also a smoothed look to them  The controls are simple  operating with a few simple mouse clicks  but are much less frustrating to deal with than your typical hand simulator  and the audio  while limited to one music track  is pretty darn rad  Overall  I enjoyed this and think it could have potential as something larger with a little work  Good job making a thing Reply dragan kill  day agosuper fun game really like it the graphics are great and concept it was cool cant wait for more Reply PseudoGrimm  day agoPhysics based games are always fun  and the theme for this is great   Like many have said  idk if I won the game or if I never found a solution at the end  but it was fun nonetheless   A game like this could be made much larger with multiple date options with different tasks suited to them   That would be really good progression   Great work Reply Albsterz  day agoThis was a really funny game  and the dates expressions were priceless  I would love to see multiple fingers so you have to control all the fingers  To make it more difficult  Reply JayPlaysOfficial  day agoI TRIED TO BE NICE    Check  Please well if there is one thing for sure  i dont think she wants to see me again XD this was a very cool game  i expected her slapping me across the face at the end  D really good job on creating this Reply Famed Killjoy  days ago Hiya  I quite enjoyed the game  The visuals are lovely and the music is fitting  I loved the progression from simply lighting a candle  to hand feeding your date meatballs  I ve yet to see a physics based system used for a dating sim  until now of course  but it was really entertaining and I thoroughly enjoyed it  It s short  sweet and funny  I hope you don t mind but I made a short let s play video of your game for my channel Cheers and best wishes  Reply Cyberwolf  days agoPretty fun little game  Not really sure if I keep getting game overs or beating it  Hope you enjoy the video  Reply Phenominis  days agoWell  I m a failure at dating  but that s okay  It was fun anyway   D Reply Raithias  days agoThis game is super hard and  will remind you a lot like hand simulator as  you try to force your hand to do various actions before  time runs out Reply Diplow  days agoLoved the games kinda reminded me of surgeon simulator with the way the charectar moves lol Reply Geg  days ago Cheers for a quick and fun game guys   a lot of humour packed into a short experienceReply Benjams  days agoit s a fun game  but no matter what i do i can t get past the part with the meatballs  does it just end there with no further coding  because no matter what i do she hands me the check Reply swav_gav  days agoHey Benjams  thanks for playing Check  Please  Due to the nature of the jam we ran out of time to implement a success   failure screen which were distinguishable from each other  Once you have fed her the   meatballs you win  We have a few ideas of what we would have done differently for the success   failure screen but to honour the rules of the LD jam we haven t updated the game yet  Thanks for playing Reply SebastianGames  days ago  turnTo bananaReply ferocioustoast  days agoThis is a really fun  short game   The facial expressions were great Reply JayskiBean  days agoThis was perfect  The game definitely embodied a perfect combination of  dating simulator  and  physics rage game    I loved it  The animation and models were fantastic and the music really set the mood for my awkward date  I was so nervous that I could barely lift the bottle of wine without spilling it everywhere  Actually  I totally spilled it everywhere  The facial expressions of my date were awesome  I knew she was absolutely enraged by how clumsy and dangerous I was being  I had a blast playing this game  It was hilarious and I don t think I d change a thing about it  I don t think I finished it  but I m pretty sure I didn t fill the glasses all the way up like I was supposed to in order to complete the task  Thanks for making this  Reply silverwolfmax  days agoVery funny little game  had a lot of fun playing it  good job devs  DReply CoalFire  days agoA physics based dating sim  I like it  The music was great  situation was ridiculous and the date went swimmingly  nothing more I could ask for  Except maybe a second date Replyitch ioÂ·View all by swav_gavÂ·ReportÂ·EmbedÂ·Updated     UTCGames
