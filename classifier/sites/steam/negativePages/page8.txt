remove the payment feature from the Skyrim workshop  For anyone who spent money on a mod  we ll be refunding you the complete amount  We talked to the team at Bethesda and they agree We ve done this because it s clear we didn t understand exactly what we were doing  We ve been shipping many features over the years aimed at allowing community creators to receive a share of the rewards  and in the past  they ve been received well  It s obvious now that this case is different To help you understand why we thought this was a good idea  our main goals were to allow mod makers the opportunity to work on their mods full time if they wanted to  and to encourage developers to provide better support to their mod communities  We thought this would result in better mods for everyone  both free   paid  We wanted more great mods becoming great products  like Dota  Counter strike  DayZ  and Killing Floor  and we wanted that to happen organically for any mod maker who wanted to take a shot at it But we underestimated the differences between our previously successful revenue sharing models  and the addition of paid mods to Skyrim s workshop  We understand our own game s communities pretty well  but stepping into an established  years old modding community in Skyrim was probably not the right place to start iterating  We think this made us miss the mark pretty badly  even though we believe there s a useful feature somewhere here Now that you ve backed a dump truck of feedback onto our inboxes  we ll be chewing through that  but if you have any further thoughts let us know   See all   comments Introducing New Ways to Support Workshop Creators   April      Alden The Steam Workshop has always been a great place for discovering community made mods  maps  and items for a variety of games  Starting now with The Elder Scrolls V  Skyrim  the Workshop is also a great place for community content creators to earn money by selling their greatest works We think this is a great opportunity to help support the incredible creative work being done by mod makers in the Steam Workshop and to encourage more top quality work  This new feature allows mod authors to choose whether to list their items for a fixed price  for pay what you want  or to make their item available for free  As a customer and fan of Skyrim  you re able to explore both paid and free mods  quests  and items The whole feature is best explained in the full press announcement and on the detailed announcement page and FAQ here   http www steamcommunity com workshop aboutpaidcontentAlong with these new options available to mod creators  we ve added a few features to support the experience and make everything as easy as possible Free  Paid  or Pay What You WantWith over   free mods available for Skyrim in the Steam Workshop  there will always be lots to do and explore for free  Now you can also find mods with a specified price  or mods where you can choose how much you wish to support the creators  The price is up to the mod creators Try any mod  Risk FreeWhen shopping for anything  it s still important to spend a little time learning about any product you are about to purchase  But  if after purchase you find that a mod is broken or doesn’t work as promised  you can easily get a refund of that mod within   hours of your purchase  View the full refund policy here Play Skyrim For

Games   January      Alden When we launched the Workshop late in   we expected that it would grow  but not that it would grow this much  this quickly  So far  the total payments made to individuals for the creation of in game items sold in Team Fortress   Dota   and Counter Strike  Global Offensive have passed   million  This money was earned by over   contributors spread out across   countries New Curated WorkshopsThe limitation of paid  revenue generating Workshops to Valve content has been an unfortunate consequence of the sheer number of challenges required in order to scale to a global audience of creators and players  Today we re happy to announce that after a ton of work  the first curated Workshops for non Valve games have opened  Dungeon Defenders  Eternity and Chivalry  Medieval Warfare This is really exciting news and means that more high quality content will be available for the game you love playing  Plus  purchases of this great new content directly enables those community members to continue practicing their craft and making more awesome content We expect more curated Workshops to become available for creators and players in various games over the coming weeks and months Introducing Revenue Tools For Workshop AuthorsThe Workshop has continued to grow and a larger number of contributors are now earning revenue from more pieces of content in a wider variety of games  To help answer questions about where revenue is coming from  we re also launching a set of new tools that enable contributors to view real time sales data for their items as well as view detailed per item revenue breakdowns and historical statements Once you have content accepted into a paid  curated Workshop  you ll see a link to "View Your Revenue" from your "My Workshop Files" page  If you don t have any content accepted yet  now s a great time to get involved   See all   comments Steam Workshop Update Adds Voting Queue and Updated Home Pages   November      Alden We just released an update for the Steam Workshop that adds a voting queue for item selection and a new home page for each Workshop to highlight cool content New Voting QueueWorkshops for games such as Team Fortress   Dota   and Counter Strike  Global Offensive include a type of items that players vote on to help determine which items can get accepted and made available for use in the game Workshops with these types of items now have a voting queue  similar to the queue in Greenlight or on the Steam home page  This queue will make it easy to discover new and interesting items to vote on  and will help the game teams get a better measure of community interest on the variety of items being considered for use in the game New Home Pages For Every WorkshopEach product Workshop now has a new home page design  helping to highlight the most interesting content in the Workshop  and to also better expose a variety of ways to browse the Workshop  With this new home page  customers can now more easily
