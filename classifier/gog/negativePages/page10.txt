On weekdays, we normally reply within 24 hours, but during weekends we can only respond that quickly to high-priority, time-sensitive cases. All other cases will be looked into first thing next week.

This section is related to issues with the games themselves.
If you need help with other problems, like buying, downloading or using GOG Galaxy, go back to the main page.

General tips:
Always make sure that both your operating system and device drivers are up to date.
If you're using Windows, you might benefit from disabling User Account Control (UAC).
Some apps and processes (anti-virus programs, browsers, messengers and video players) can interfere with games. You should try disabling them if you’re having problems, but disable your Internet connection before tinkering with anti-virus and firewall software - just in case.
