below saying  Connect now  The thing is if I click it it wont connect It just sends me to the code redeem thing  For Screenshots and a GIF add me on Discord  xGrazziy  Would be nice if you could help me  Do you own the game Is it actually in your library on your GOGcom account I think this is usually related to the game not being on your account so Galaxy shows offline and a redeem page because certain Galaxy features cant be used unless you are using the account that owns the game   Of course it doesnt pevent you from playing the game though That the only thing I can think of that may be causing that    Ra     Ra     Pedimos desculpas dados do usuário estão atualmente indisponíveis Tente novamente mais tarde  Ver lista de desejos Iniciar conversa Convidar amigos Convidar amigos
