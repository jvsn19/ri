I think this is usually related to the game not being on your account so Galaxy shows offline and a redeem page because certain Galaxy features can't be used unless you are using the account that owns the game.   Of course it doesn't pevent you from playing the game though. That the only thing I can think of that may be causing that.    .Ra     .Ra     Pedimos desculpas, dados do usuário estão atualmente indisponíveis. Tente novamente mais tarde.

Rep: 10Registered: Nov 2017From United StatesPosted 20 hours ago1466It would be great if we can see our games with the grid shelf view offline. Currently you can't see them if you don't have an internet connection. At least make it so that you can see your installed games with the shelf view even if you are offline like you can see them on the left side currently.
