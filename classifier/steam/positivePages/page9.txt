Cuphead















								Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game heavily focused on boss battles. Inspired by cartoons of the 1930s, the visuals and audio are painstakingly created with the same techniques of the era, i.e. traditional hand drawn cel animation, watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings.

Curator Review


 










Recommended 
													By Cynical Brit Gaming 2 October, 2017


“A contender to dethrone DOTA as Steams premier misery simulator. A difficult 2d boss-rush game with gorgeous aesthetic and soundtrack inspired by old Disney cartoons. You will die, a lot.”

Cupdate - Hotfix v1.1.4
Hotfix Patch Notes 1.1.4• Fixed soft lock when the player parries and dies at the same time• Fixed issue where game appears in a tiny resolution• Fixed rare issue where loading screen plays forever• Fixed Cagney Carnation face attack so it consistently has proper anticipation cue timingAdditionally, we are now offering a "Legacy" branch of Cuphead under the Betas tab in the properties window. The Legacy branch of Cuphead will be the exact launch build of Cuphead, with no applied patches and no future support. It contains all of the exploits and bugs of the launch version and is available for those who prefer to play that version. WARNING - Switching to the Legacy version of Cuphead may corrupt or erase your present saves. The Legacy version and Current version of Cuphead share the same pool of saves and moving between the two of them has a high probability of corrupting or erasing your present Cuphead saves. StudioMDHR offers no present or future support for the Legacy version of Cuphead. Use it at your own risk.
