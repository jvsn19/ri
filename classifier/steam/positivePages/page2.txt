27 March
Welcome to the Far Cry Arcade Editor!
On our website you can find this same guide localized in many other languages:French, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Russian, Arabic, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Dutch.IntroductionWelcome to the Far Cry Arcade Editor! With this tool, you are able to make solo maps, 2-player co-op maps and multiplayer maps for up to 12 players. There are six game modes in total: Assault, Outpost, Journey, Bounty Hunt, Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. What’s more, there are over 10,000 objects you can use from Far Cry 5, Far Cry 4, Far Cry Primal, Watch Dogs, Assassin’s Creed Black Flag and Assassin’s Creed Unity to create any kind of map you like.This guide will take you through the basic process of making your first map in each of these game modes, but in each case, you should take the time to explore all the options and settings the editor has to offer.  You can add objects, enemies, animals, and health, weapon and ammo pickups. You can change the terrain, add water, underground areas, and change the weather, time of day, and other environment settings.  And you can even fully customise up to four weapon and ammo loadouts to encourage different playstyles.  Infinite maps, infinite fun – it all starts here!Initial Map SetupAfter launching the Far Cry Arcade Editor choose the “New Map” option. The next window that appears will ask for the game mode. Each game mode requires specific game mode objects to be included to make sure the map can be played correctly. These are things like spawn points, objectives and extraction points. You can also choose the terrain type for your map. Once the map has been generated, you will find the game mode objects you need by first clicking on the Objects icon at the top of the screen, then selecting Game mode objects in the browser that opens on the right side of the screen. The Game mode objects panel appears at the bottom of this browser. Each game mode will have a different list of objects.AssaultIn Assault, the objective is to eliminate all enemies on the map.To set up an Assault map, you need two elements:A spawn point – this is where your character starts on the map at the beginning of a mission.You’ll find the Spawn Point object under Game mode objects. After clicking on its thumbnail, you can place the Spawn Point by clicking in the map where you want to place itAI enemies – these are your mission objective.You can place enemies in the map by clicking on the AI Management icon right next to the Objects icon. In this menu, you can select the type of AI that you want to place; which factions they belong to (enemies, allies, neutral or animals), what type of character they are, and at which time the AI appears during the missionsFor Assault, it is required that you have at least one AI on the map belonging to the Enemies faction, in Wave 1.The ‘waves’ system, as its name indicates, spawns enemies in waves. Enemies placed in Wave 1 will already be present in the map when the player enters it. You can use the “Trigger” option in the AI management screen when a wave is selected (except for Wave 1) to choose when that wave should start spawning. It can be set to spawn when one enemy from the previous wave is dead, 25% of that wave is dead, 50%, or 75%.With these spawn points and enemies in place, you will be ready to start a basic round of Assault. Now you’re ready to find the theme and flavour of your map by adding objects, editing the terrain, and more.OutpostSimilarly to Assault, the aim is to eliminate all enemies in the map. But the introduction of the alarm post object adds some more requirements to your map creation. Here are the required elements to create an Outpost map.A spawn point (See Assault section above)An alarm post, which the enemy AI from Wave 1 will try to reach and use if they detect the player. The alarm can be added to the map in the same way as the spawn point, by selecting its thumbnail in the Game mode objects folder, and placing it in your map. Be careful to make sure it’s reachable for the enemy AI from Wave 1. AI enemies (See Assault section above)In Outpost, Wave 2 of enemies can only be triggered if the alarm has been sounded. This happens if the player is detected and the enemy AI reaches the alarm post. Waves 3 to 5 can use the same triggers as described in the Assault section above.Remember, alarms and Waves 2-5 of enemies are optional, depending on how difficult you want the map to be.You can also change some of the modifiers that can increase the challenge. Click the Gameplay Modifiers icon in the top row of the main window to see the list. For example, Game Over on Detection will force players to remain stealthy at all times. And a time limit with the Countdown modifier to increase the pressure even further.JourneyThe objective in Journey is to simply reach the exit from your starting location. Here are the elements required:A spawn point (See Assault section above)An exit, called an extraction zone, which can be found in the Game mode objects folder. The map is completed once the player enters that area. You can resize this object by accessing its Object preferences and using the 3 sliders.Those two elements are the only requirements to create a Journey map. However, the real fun of a Journey map is making the rest of the map interesting to navigate through. You can make the map as open or maze-like as you want. And you can add enemies or animals for challenge or flavour.Bounty HuntIn Bounty Hunt maps, you must eliminate a specific target enemy (or multiple target enemies) before reaching the exit.These maps require three elements to be ready for gameplay:A spawn pointTarget enemy AI – your mission objectiveNo matter how many enemy AI characters you use in a Bounty Hunt mission, at least one of them must be defined as a target.The first step is to add AI to the map. (See Assault section above)To set an AI as a target, select the Target icon to the left of Objects at the top of the screen. You can add or remove AI to the list of targets by clicking on them in the map. The following AI can be set as targets:EnemiesMost animals (except fish, birds, and some other exceptions)An exit, called the extraction zone in the editor (See Journey section above)Your Bounty Hunt mission will be ready once these three conditions have been set. Try and find fun ways to position your targets in the map and feel free to add additional enemies or animals to challenge the player.You can also make the map easier by applying Targets Visible from Start from the Gameplay Modifiers list (click the Gameplay Modifiers icon at the top of the screen to see the list). Without this modifier, players will have to use their binoculars to find and tag the targets – and it’s up to you if you want to give players the binoculars or not in the first place!DeathmatchDeathmatch is a no-nonsense free-for-all with a simple goal: kill more players than everybody else within the given time limit. Reaching the score sooner will end the match early. Eliminated players return to the fray at a random spawn point moments later to continue accumulating points until the round has reached its end.Setting up a Deathmatch requires one gameplay element:A Deathmatch map needs at least twelve spawn points, found in the Game mode objects folder.More spawn points means more possible locations to spawn at.With twelve or more spawn points in place, your Deathmatch map is ready to go. There is a default Countdown (time limit) and Score to Reach which can be adjusted in the Gameplay Modifiers list.Also consider adding multiple loadouts so that players can experiment with different playstyles. Click the Loadouts icon in the top of the screen to explore and experiment with different weapons, ammo types, throwables, gear, health, and the ability-boosting homeopathics.Team DeathmatchTeam Deathmatch is a classic team-based battle. Two teams of up to 6 players each compete to rack up the most kills in the time limit.The requirements for this game mode are similar to the standard Deathmatch:Team Deathmatch requires a minimum of twelve spawn points; at least six for Team 1, and at least six for Team 2Spawn Point Team 1 and Spawn Point Team 2 can be found in the Game mode objects folder.You also have the option to add mixed spawn points to switch things up. These are spawn points where players from either team can randomly respawn during the match.You can add them by using the Spawn Point Multi, also found in the Game mode objects browser, in the same way as the Team 1 and Team 2 spawn points.Just like Deathmatch, you’ll be ready to go with twelve starting positions on a Team Deathmatch map.  Also like Deathmatch, you can adjust the default Countdown (time limit) and Score to Reach. For Loadouts, you can give the same loadouts to each team, or set different loadouts for an asymmetrical experience. Gameplay Modifiers can also be global, or per-team.For all game modes, it’s also necessary to take a snapshot of your map, which will be displayed as a thumbnail for your map. This thumbnail will be visible for other players when they browse maps, or in a lobby when it’s time to vote for a map. To take the snapshot, click on the “Map properties” icon on top of the screen, and select “Capture” after placing the camera where you want to.
