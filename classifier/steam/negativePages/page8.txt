Feature From Skyrim Workshop  April   Alden Were going to remove the payment feature from the Skyrim workshop For anyone who spent money on a mod well be refunding you the complete amount We talked to the team at Bethesda and they agreeWeve done this because its clear we didnt understand exactly what we were doing Weve been shipping many features over the years aimed at allowing community creators to receive a share of the rewards and in the past theyve been received well Its obvious now that this case is differentTo help you understand why we thought this was a good idea our main goals were to allow mod makers the opportunity to work on their mods full time if they wanted to and to encourage developers to provide better support to their mod communities We thought this would result in better mods for everyone both free  paid We wanted more great mods becoming great products like Dota Counterstrike DayZ and Killing Floor and we wanted that to happen organically for any mod maker who wanted to take a shot at itBut we underestimated the differences between our previously successful revenue sharing models and the addition of paid mods to Skyrims workshop We understand our own games communities pretty well but stepping into an established years old modding community in Skyrim was probably not the right place to start iterating We think this made us miss the mark pretty badly even though we believe theres a useful feature somewhere hereNow that youve backed a dump truck of feedback onto our inboxes well be chewing through that but if you have any further thoughts let us know  See all  comments Introducing New Ways to Support Workshop Creators  April   Alden The Steam Workshop has always been a great place for discovering communitymade mods maps and items for a variety of

but not that it would grow this much this quickly So far the total payments made to individuals for the creation of ingame items sold in Team Fortress  Dota  and CounterStrike Global Offensive have passed  million This money was earned by over  contributors spread out across  countriesNew Curated WorkshopsThe limitation of paid revenuegenerating Workshops to Valve content has been an unfortunate consequence of the sheer number of challenges required in order to scale to a global audience of creators and players Today were happy to announce that after a ton of work the first curated Workshops for nonValve games have opened Dungeon Defenders Eternity and Chivalry Medieval WarfareThis is really exciting news and means that more high quality content will be available for the game you love

available for creators and players in various games over the coming weeks and monthsIntroducing Revenue Tools For Workshop AuthorsThe Workshop has continued to grow and a larger number of contributors are now earning revenue from more pieces of content in a wider variety of games To help answer questions about where revenue is coming from were also launching a set of new tools that enable contributors to view realtime sales data for their items as well as view detailed peritem revenue breakdowns and historical statementsOnce you have content accepted into a paid curated Workshop youll
