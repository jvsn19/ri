 If a game does not workIf a game does not work or install, it does not mean that the game is broken or faulty. There is a large number of reasons for that. For some games and usual problems we have FAQ section, where you can find a lot of answers to a number of questions. Please do consult the FAQ section and only after trying the recommended actions from it, contact support@gamersgate.com for prompt help.
Some tips to follow during the whole process are the following:

When downloading the Download file of the game, save it to your hard drive rather than just running it from the browser. 
Upgrade your video drivers to the latest version - at least DirectX 9c. Actually, many games NEED 9c to work. Running 10 or 11 are not always good enough. DirectX can be found at www.microsoft.com 
If you run games under Windows Vista, then try running "as administrator": for that you to right click on the icon of the game, then chose "run as administrator"
If you are using Windows XP and Vista it is better to have administrative rights on your account.
You also may try using Compatibility Mode when running games on Vista: right click on the game icon, choose Properties tab and there will be a "Compatibility" tab with different settings
Sometimes lowering down security/or turning it off and see if it changes the situation - it may block the execution or files or block access to/from them.
If you have a problem with a game, try downloading it one more time, but to a folder somewhere else that a system folder - like Desktop, or C:/Program Files. Try not running it from the browser, because its better you save the file to your hard drive.
If you still have no progress see if you can try to download and install on another PC and check if it is a game related problem, or a PC related one. 
Network storage.Will not work. You need to download and install the games on local drives.Please insert CD/DVD in drive C:This problem may be due to...
1.You have got a demo of the game installed. Make sure you uninstall the demo before installing the full game.
2. You have patched the game with a patch for the disc version of the game. You must use a patch for a digital version of the game. If you cant find such patch on the official web sit or at the My Games section at GamersGate, please provide us the patch number and we will ask the developers about it.
3. Sometimes the "Run" option in Windows will not work. Download the file and double click it intead.
4. Network storage will not work. You must download and install on local drives.
 
If you need assistance, you can send an email to support@gamersgate.com and you will be helped promptly.Slow speed for my DownloadMay be caused due to proxys, firewalls, antivirus, wireless connections etc. Check your settings and if neccessery, disable what can be disabled.Virus / trojan detected in the download?There are NO viruses or trojans in the download.  Its likely your anti-virus program having what is called a "false positive". It may have found something in the heuristic search, which is not always 100% accurate. The games are delivered from developers and publishers, so the risk of having an infected download is minimal.
 
NOTE: For BitDefender you may turn off real time protection.Where are my downloads storedThe game is stored in the same folder/location you run the Downloader from. When you run the Downloader, a folder named "GamersGate temporary files" will be created and the game files will be stored in that folder.
The Downloader it self are saved to your usual download storage that you have choosed in your Browser settings.
After the download is complete you will be asked if you want to remove the files or not.Will I be able to install the game on my new computer once I upgrade my hardware?Yes, you can download and install your games as many times you like. Once bought the game is yours to use whenever you want.Windows 7 prevents the downloadTurning off write-protection on the temporary files is enough to make the installer work properly with them.Write access is denied to critical file \"/volumes/hearts of iron 3/hearts of iron 3/data/HOI3.vpfs"! Game cannot be started. Please ensure that the game had full access to folder "volumes/hearts of iron 3/hearts of iron 3/data" and all its contents.You are not dragging the game to the applications folder. You are probably trying to run the Downloader on the mounted DMG, where there is no write access.MoreError-messages"d3dx9_XX.dll Missing" messageUpdate your DirectX from www.microsoft.com.
NOTE:
Some games need DirectX 9c to work. Having DirectX 10 or 11 are not always good enough.
Windows Vista allows to use only DirectX version 10, meaning that games that require the previous version will sometimes not run on Vista due to this reason. Possible solution is to use Compatibility mode.
For this:
1) Right click on the icon that executes the game
2) Chose compatibility tab
3) Select the required operating system in the offered fields.

Usually this folder will always be accessible to any account, unless your system has been intentionally modified, e.g. folder permissions or ownerships have been changed or there are monitoring tools running on the PC denying access to this folder.Arial font problemsThis problem may be caused by having a corrupted Arial font file.

If you run games under Windows Vista, then try running "as administrator": for that you to right click on the icon of the game, then chose "run as administrator"
If you are using Windows XP and Vista it is better to have administrative rights on your account.

Sometimes lowering down security/or turning it off and see if it changes the situation - it may block the execution or files or block access to/from them.
If you have a problem with a game, try downloading it one more time, but to a folder somewhere else that a system folder - like Desktop, or C:/Program Files. Try not running it from the browser, because its better you save the file to your hard drive.

2) Chose compatibility tab

Sometimes lowering down security/or turning it off and see if it changes the situation - it may block the execution or files or block access to/from them.
If you have a problem with a game, try downloading it one more time, but to a folder somewhere else that a system folder - like Desktop, or C:/Program Files. Try not running it from the browser, because its better you save the file to your hard drive.
If you still have no progress see if you can try to download and install on another PC and check if it is a game related problem, or a PC related one. 

The file may also be corrupted. Several reasons can cause this - first maybe you have a virus. Do check this by running a virs/malware scan. Or while downloading the game something may have happened and you downloaded a corrupted file - then you may try to redownload it (maybe to another folder).

ADVICE: Do read the game details on games page to know what is required for a particular game/expansion to be installed."Server did not accept the request (replied HTTP status; 200, expected 206)" messageThis may happen due to different reasons. Some of them may be:

1) An anti-virus application may be blocking/filtering the download. Lower the anti-virus settings or disable the antivirus during the download.
2) Your internet service provider may use a built-in security service, which detects suspicious sites and checks if they are containing viruses,trojans, worms and etc. It probably filtered your download domain and caused problems to the download manager when it tried to countinue downloading.
